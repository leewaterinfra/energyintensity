# energyintensity

The `energyintensity` R package is used to model the embedded energy within a
water distribution system. This is done using system meter data and a simple
network model. The result is an estimate of the energy intensity of water, at
various locations throughout the treatment and distribution system.

## Installation

You can install the `energyintensity` package from github with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("ucd-cwee/energyintensity")
